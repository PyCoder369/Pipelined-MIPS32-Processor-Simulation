# Pipelined-MIPS32-Processor-Simulation
This project implements a 5-stage pipelined MIPS32 processor in Verilog, simulating the fetch, decode, execute, memory, and write-back stages. A testbench validates correct execution of arithmetic, logical, and control-flow instructions, as well as register and memory operations.
